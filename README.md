# Marty's MTA SA Map Cut Tool

You can use this tool to split an area from an existing map.

Useful if you made a large map with objects all around San Andreas, but want to remove all objects in a specific area (and perhaps use that in a different map resource).

Make sure the "location" resource is activated (available in community) and do /getpos ingame to get the required values. 


### Installation

Download the ZIP, extract the folder somewhere and launch **mapcuttool.html**.
